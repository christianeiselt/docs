# Screenshots

*   [Automate generating screenshots with fastlane and snapshot](https://andreaslydemann.com/automate-screenshots-for-app-store-using-fastlane/)
*   [Add frames, background, and text with frameit](https://andreaslydemann.com/automate-screenshot-framing-with-text-using-fastlane/)

Checklist for really great screenshots:
*   Screenshots localised in all languages your app supports
*   Different screenshots for different device types to have the correct font in your screenshots
*   Same content in all languages and device types (means same screens visible with the same items)
*   No loading indicators should be visible, not even in the status bar
*   No scrolling indicators should be visible
*   A clean status bar: Full battery, full Wifi and of course 9:41
*   Localised titles above your screenshots
*   Device in screenshots actually matches the device of the user (except for the color)
*   A nice looking background behind the frames
*   Optionally a coloured title around the device frame
