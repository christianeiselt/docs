# Screenshots
Checklist for really great screenshots:
- [x] Screenshots localised in all languages your app supports
- [x] Different screenshots for different device types to have the correct font in your screenshots
- [x] Same content in all languages and device types (means same screens visible with the same items)
- [x] No loading indicators should be visible, not even in the status bar
- [x] No scrolling indicators should be visible
- [x] A clean status bar: Full battery, full Wifi and of course 9:41
- [x] Localised titles above your screenshots
- [x] Device in screenshots actually matches the device of the user (except for the color)
- [x] A nice looking background behind the frames
- [x] Optionally a coloured title around the device frame
