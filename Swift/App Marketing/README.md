# App Marketing

## Idea Validation

### The Starbucks Approch
- Chat to stranger
- Your brother has an idea
- What do they think?

### Google Trends
- research after app idea / problem to be addressed / keyword
- compare different keywords
- timing of launch
- get information about countries to target (-> localization, etc.)
- related topics / queries

## Google AdWords
- keyword planner
- search for keywords
- how many are searching per month
- size of competition (if low - why? (difficult to monetize?)

## Landing Page (months before actually writing code)
- heading, small description of product
- register to be notified when product launches
- will help to determine interest in product

### Targeted ads toward landing page
- multiple different ads (different images, texts, targets, etc.) to determine best effect
- target keyword of outcome of using product (i.e. "weight loss" for fitness app)
- set limit / automatic bidding / maximize clicks
- max bid 0.50$, increase by 0.25$ every two hours until users are clicking on the ads, then observe whether clicks are turn to registered emails on landing page
- really cheap way of idea validation 
- "Buy now" button to check for buying intent for idea (then notify when next batch is available)
