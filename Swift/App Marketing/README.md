# App Marketing

## Idea Validation

### The Starbucks Approch
- Chat to stranger
- Your brother has an idea
- What do they think?

### Google Trends
- research after app idea / problem to be addressed / keyword
- compare different keywords
- timing of launch
- get information about countries to target (-> localization, etc.)
- related topics / queries

## Google AdWords
- keyword planner
- search for keywords
- how many are searching per month
- size of competition (if low - why? (difficult to monetize?)

## Landing Page (months before actually writing code)
- heading, small description of product
- register to be notified when product launches
- will help to determine interest in product

### Targeted ads toward landing page
- multiple different ads (different images, texts, targets, etc.) to determine best effect
- target keyword of outcome of using product (i.e. "weight loss" for fitness app)
- set limit / automatic bidding / maximize clicks
