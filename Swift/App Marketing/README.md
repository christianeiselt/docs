# App Marketing

## Idea Validation

### The Starbucks Approach
-   Chat to stranger
-   Your brother has an idea
-   What do they think?

### Google Trends
-   research after app idea / problem to be addressed / keyword
-   compare different keywords
-   timing of launch
-   get information about countries to target (-> localization, etc.)
-   related topics / queries

### Google AdWords
-   keyword planner
-   search for keywords
-   how many are searching per month
-   size of competition (if low - why? (difficult to monetize?)

### Landing Page
-   heading, small description of product
-   register to be notified when product launches
-   will help to determine interest in product

#### Targeted ads toward landing page
-   multiple different ads (different images, texts, targets, etc.) to determine best effect
-   target keyword of outcome of using product (i.e. "weight loss" for fitness app)
-   set limit / automatic bidding / maximize clicks
-   max bid 0.50$, increase by 0.25$ every two hours until users are clicking on the ads, then observe whether clicks are turn to registered emails on landing page
-   really cheap way of idea validation 
-   "Buy now" button to check for buying intent for idea (then notify when next batch is available)

### Creating a minimum viable product
-   core / fundamental concept of app that provides a use

### Crowdfunding
-   see if people would actually pay for your product

## Monetizing
-   first 24h, 7days and 30days performance is crucial to getting it featured or highlighted in some ranking

### Paid App
-   app is front of a website with 
-   really special (i.e. niche or unique) product
-   commercial (i.e. created/licensed/patented) content

#### Pricing
-   single use app should be less than 1.99$ (else will get bad reviews)
-   play around with pricing

### In-App-Purchases
-   App Store company will take cut

#### Virtual goods (i.e. gems, money, energy)
-   must go through app store

#### Physical money
-   can go through app store (with cut) or externally

#### Freemium model
-   IAP should be for the final 20 per cent of the apps features
-   will attract bad reviews if only 5 per cent of features are included in the free version 

#### White labeling
-   skinnable app for several businesses (i.e. gym member app)

#### Partnership
-   real world attachments -> incentives (sponsorship deal) by companies (i.e Sanitas Active)
-   user, app developer and advertiser benefit

## App Listing

### App Icon
-   Design is important (-> Design Course)

#### Good icon
-   never with text (does not scale well)
-   simple and iconic

#### Split testing
-   split test app icons against each other (check if App Store offers this now, else i.e. with Storemaven.com) 
-   ask designer for micro variations of the winning icon and test again for highest conversion (download) rate

##### Freelance Designers
-   always ask for more than one icon (at least five or six with slight variations)

#### fiverr.com
-   5$ per Design

-   Checks
    -   Design must be for commercial use (might be an addon) -> get in writing!
    -   Quality varies a lot
    -   Reverse google search to check that design is not just stolen from the internet

#### 99designs.com
-   only pay if design is as wanted

### Screenshots
1.  only screenshots, hope that the user will figure out what they mean
2.  text above screenshot to tell what the feature on the screenshot is
3.  fullblown designed screenshot

-   use split testing as well

#### Not good
-   no images that look like stock photography
-   max 2 sentences, ideally just a phrase if text is needed

#### Tools
-   mockuphone.com
-   launchkit.io
-   mockups for all different devices
