# App Marketing

## Idea Validation

### The Starbucks Approach
-   Chat to stranger
-   Your brother has an idea
-   What do they think?

### Google Trends
-   research after app idea / problem to be addressed / keyword
-   compare different keywords
-   timing of launch
-   get information about countries to target (-> localization, etc.)
-   related topics / queries

### Google AdWords
-   keyword planner
-   search for keywords
-   how many are searching per month
-   size of competition (if low - why? (difficult to monetize?)

### Landing Page
-   heading, small description of product
-   register to be notified when product launches
-   will help to determine interest in product

#### Targeted ads toward landing page
-   multiple different ads (different images, texts, targets, etc.) to determine best effect
-   target keyword of outcome of using product (i.e. "weight loss" for fitness app)
-   set limit / automatic bidding / maximize clicks
-   max bid 0.50$, increase by 0.25$ every two hours until users are clicking on the ads, then observe whether clicks are turn to registered emails on landing page
-   really cheap way of idea validation 
-   "Buy now" button to check for buying intent for idea (then notify when next batch is available)

### Creating a minimum viable product
-   core / fundamental concept of app that provides a use

### Crowdfunding
-   see if people would actually pay for your product
